# Website Performance Shiny App
### Shiny App interactive dashboard reporting on various website performance metrics

This exercise shows how an interactive reporting application can be developed using R, Shiny, Plotly, and Shinyapps.io. Data has been created for a fake website to show how we can track both the number, and conversion rates of users landing on a website. This data has been tracked from the users arrival to the page, all the way down to the eventual sale, and associated sales metrics (E.g. Revenue, Gross Spread, % Spread, etc.). This data has been trended over time as changes to retail websites are made on a regular basis. Knowing the timing of the change, and the resulting impact it has on user's behavior is crucial for any sites success.

Shinyapps.io was chosen for this hosting service, but Shiny Apps are more commonly hosted on local servers where ETL jobs can be scheduled to retrieve data as needed. While the attached documents show how a Shiny App can be created, there are additional steps that must be taken to publish the app on the cloud using Shinyapps.io. Namely, the creation of a Shinyapps.io account, as well as connecting that account to the RStudio IDE. Instructions for this process can be found in the [here.](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/index.html)
